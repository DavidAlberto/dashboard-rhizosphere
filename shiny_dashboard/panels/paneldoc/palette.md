**NOTE:** This is merely a documentation panel.

The following subsections define
different options available
in one or more of the `Palette` and `Theme` widgets
that are **located on other panels**
in Shiny-phyloseq.

Please inspect the documentation reproduced here,
and especially the interactive `Palette` and `Theme` widgets'
provided on the left hand side.
By changing their input,
you can quickly see their influence on the example scatter plot on the right.
The data itself is simply a small static example dataset,
and the data has absolutely nothing to do
with the data you have selected in the `Data` panel
or have explored on other panels.
